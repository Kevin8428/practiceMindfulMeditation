                <h2>It decreases stress and anxiety</h2>
                <p>There’s a seemingly endless amount of research showing connections to mindfulness meditation and lower stress/anxiety. A great introductory read is in the Harvard Gazette, which highlights results of a 2011 study by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in which 16 participants received MRI’s two weeks before and after completing an 8 week mindfulness meditaiton program. Britta Holzel, an author of the study and fellow at MGH wrote “ It is fascinating to see the brain’s plasticity and that, by practicing meditation, we can play an active role in changing the brain and can increase our well-being and quality of life.”</p>

                <h2>It Improves Self Compassion</h2>
                <p>In June 2015 researchers from the of Psychology at Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, and the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin released a study titled “Self-Compassion and Body Dissasisfaction in Women: A randomized Conrolled Tirla of a Brief Meditation Intervention.” In this study, women were split into two groups. The first received three-week self-compassion meditation training, while the other remained a control group. Results for women practicing meditaiton showed "significantly greater reduction in body dissatisfaction, body shame and contingent self-worth based on appearance, as well as greater gains in self-compassion and body appreciation”</p>
